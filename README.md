# Sentiment-Analysis
This project describes a system for analysis of
public sentiment expressed on Twitter, a microblogging
service.In this project, I focused on
exploratory analysis for figuring out the sentiments of the
people in United States post Elections. For this purpose,
twitter corpus is collected and linguistic analysis is
performed on the collected corpus. Using the training
corpus, a Sentiment Classifier is trained, which is able to
detect positive, negative, neutral and sarcastic sentiments. A
comparative study is also performed using multiple machine
learning algorithms for sentiment analysis on tweets. This
comparative analysis also shows the best way for selecting
the classifier on the basis of accuracy. Different algorithms
are used for the confidence level of the result. After labeling
the sentiments, an attempt was made to visualize different
trends in the sentiments based on all of the findings.
